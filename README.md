# Archival Recordings from St. Charles, Illinois Class of '82 #

## Reggae Roots with Aster Black (and Squeaky) ##

<audio controls>
  <source src="reggae-roots.mp3" />
</audio>

Circa 1980.

Audio quality is pretty poor, could be in part from the original show... it was low-fi!  All
things considered, this is pretty good for a 30 year old "Intermagnetics" cassette tape.

## Azgaard at Thompson Junior High ##

Was this their first gig?

Sounds like it was recorded in a gym?  Yep, it was recorded in a gym.

## Abortions Live at Punkfest ##

Circa 1980.

I don't know what to say.... enjoy?
